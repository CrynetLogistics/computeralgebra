1a)What the colours and colour bands mean. So for low iterations, 
all points that lie within a region of similar colour took the 
same number of iterations to converge.
1b)The reason why the bands are less evident in higher iterations
is because the difference in colour of the different bands of
colour is less evident as there are more iterations to represent
in our colour space.
1c)There are black regions in the centres of certain fractals,
these represent locations where they are possibly divergent
but takes longer than 7*255 iterations to diverge, and with more
iterations, these black regions reduce in size.
